# Car-Price-Prediction<br>
This is the implementation of some Exploratory Data Analytics and different machine learning algorithms on the famous regression problem: Car price Prediction.<br/>
The dataset has 18 columns out of which price is the output label.
The best accuracy was given by XGB model with a MAE of 5851.
A lower MAE was achieved by a Random Forst model (4922) but the model suffered from overfitting.
I ahve also implemented a flask app to run on this model.
